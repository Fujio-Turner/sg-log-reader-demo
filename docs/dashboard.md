### Getting the Dashboard

To get to the dashboard to see stats you will run a local Python Flask Web Server. Run the command below to start the web server.

```console
 python3 app.py config.json
```

OUTPUT should look something like this.

```console
 * Serving Flask app 'app'
 * Debug mode: off
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:8080
 * Running on http://192.168.0.193:8080
```

Now open up your web browser and go to: [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080)


Just click the <button>Search</button> button you should get some results.

To learn more about searching and filtering your results in the dashboard go to the `How to Search & Filter` page.
